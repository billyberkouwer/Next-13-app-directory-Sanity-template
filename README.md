## About

This template sets up a Next 13 app directory project with Sanity at the path /studio. It includes files to configure live preview. It uses SASS for styling and also contains a few helpful Sanity objects and plugins such as the Singleton plugin for Sanity.

This template is adapted from Aron Hafner's (@hafffe). [`Their template`](https://github.com/hafffe/nextjs-sanity-template) contains a comprehensive configuration that uses Tailwind for styling. The purpose of this template is to provide a more bare-bones solution that is quicker to customize.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
